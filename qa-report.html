			 <li><b> What does Quality Assurance  mean for website development? </b>  </li>
			 <li>Quality assurance is a review of the website before it reaches the end user to try and uncover design flaws in the website or the UI that were overlooked during its design and development.  </li>
		</ul>

			 <li> <b> Describe the two key principles of Quality Assurance: "Fit for Purpose" and "Right First Time." </b> </li>
			 <li>“Fit for Purpose” is the design goal that the product you make should be usable in the manner that you intended to use it for.  For example, a boat that sinks or a car that doesn’t start because of design flaws would not be fit for purpose. </li>
			 <li> “Right First Time” is the design goal that you get everything correct before the release of your product, so that you do not have to go back to work on it again. This is done by minimizing product issues and due diligence during validation. </li>
		</ul>

			 <li> <b> How do web standards relate to web quality? </b> </li>
			 <li> Web standards are set by the W3C and relate to things like making sure that websites will display on a number of different browsers and that aspects of design such as font and color can be easily changed with the modification of a single style sheet instead of many pages worth of code.  </li>

			 <p> <b> What is web accessability and what steps can you take to make sure you web page is more accessible? </b> 
			 <br> Web accessibility is a measure of how well ANY person can interact with your webpage.  It accounts for physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and socio economic restrictions. 
			 <br> Some ways you can make you website more accessible are:<p>
				<li> Not relying on color as a navigational tool or to differentiate parts of your page.  </li>
				<li> Images should all have alt text. </li>
				<li> Videos on your site should have audio captioning. </li>
				<li> Include a skip navigation feature. </li>
				<li> Include text to voice considerations such as emphasis.</li>
